Consultant

Consultants are employees of the Unique Meal who are in direct contact with the members.
They process the requests of the members. Hence, they need to be able to manage the member’s information and data. For this purpose, when a new client requests for membership,
a consultant needs to register the client's information in the system. So, the minimum required functions of a consultant in the system are summarized as below:

● To update their own password

● To add a new member to the system

● To modify or update the information of a member in the system

● To search and retrieve the information of a member (check note 2 below).
